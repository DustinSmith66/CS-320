software automation and testing
I can ensure my code/program is secure by testing my code to check for any issues that may arise in my code
I interpret user needs by understand what are the needs and the wants in a program. I also believe researching and asking questions to understand how to better approach any concerns.
I approach designing software by understanding what is being designed first and then researching to see the best possible solutions to solve any issues if I do not know how to do them. Asking questions and communication with a team is key in bringing any great software design to life. I test my software multiple times until I find the best quality of software for the user.
